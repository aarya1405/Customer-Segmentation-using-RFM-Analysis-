**Methodology & Technical Approach**

- Analyzed Los Angeles crime data (2020–2025) using the official Crime Data from 2020 to Present dataset
- Processed over 1 million crime records containing temporal, geographic, demographic, and offense-level attributes
- Integrated economic indicators (unemployment rate) from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED) to assess macroeconomic relationships
- Performed comprehensive data inspection to evaluate schema, data types, completeness, and memory usage
- Identified high-null, redundant, or semantically ambiguous columns
- Removed 12 low-value columns including vague crime codes, redundant geographic fields, and sparsely populated attributes
- Executed structured data cleaning by:
    - Converting date and time fields to standardized datetime formats
    - Handling missing values using domain-appropriate defaults (e.g., “Unknown”, “No Weapon Used”)
    - Mapping coded categorical variables (victim sex, descent) to interpretable labels
    - Removing redundant identifiers and resolving inconsistent formats
- Engineered new analytical features:
    - Crime severity classification (Serious vs Less Serious)
    - Victim age categories (Juvenile, Adult, Senior Citizen)
    - Time-of-day buckets (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night)
    - Monthly and yearly aggregation keys for temporal analysis
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify crime patterns and trends
- Analyzed yearly and monthly crime volumes to identify long-term trends
- Identified crime peaks in 2022–2023 followed by declines influenced by reporting system changes
- Evaluated seasonal patterns, identifying January as the highest-crime month and December as the lowest
- Performed crime-type frequency analysis
- Identified Vehicle Theft as the most frequent crime (>10% of all incidents)
- Followed by Simple Assault and Burglary from Vehicle
- Conducted regional crime analysis across LAPD divisions
- Identified Central, 77th Street, and Pacific as highest-crime regions
- Identified Foothill, Hollenbeck, and Mission as lowest-crime regions
- Integrated unemployment data and performed correlation analysis
- Identified a negative correlation between unemployment rates and crime volume
- Interpreted results in the context of COVID-19 lockdowns and post-pandemic mobility
- Performed day-of-week and time-of-day analysis
- Found highest crime frequency on Fridays and Saturdays
- Found most crimes occurring at night (9 PM – 5 AM)
- Conducted demographic analysis
- Found average victim age in the late 30s
- Observed slightly higher average victim age for female victims
- Identified crimes against older victims concentrated in theft-related offenses
- Implemented outlier and anomaly detection
- Used IQR and Z-score methods to identify anomalous months
- Flagged late-2024 and all 2025 data as unreliable due to LAPD reporting system changes
- Validated anomalies using heatmap visualization
- Applied time-series forecasting techniques
- Implemented ARIMA for yearly crime forecasting (excluding incomplete 2025 data)
- Forecasted stabilization near 120,000 crimes per year over the next three years
- Implemented Prophet for monthly forecasting including trend and seasonality
- Forecasted continued decline toward ~7,500 crimes per month by 2026, with high uncertainty
- Developed extensive visualizations:
    - Time-series trend plots
    - Crime frequency bar charts
    - Regional comparisons
    - Correlation scatter plots
    - Heatmaps for anomaly detection
    - Forecast plots with confidence intervals
- Consolidated findings into a structured analytical report with documented assumptions, limitations, and interpretations

**Technical Emphasis**

- Large-scale real-world data cleaning
- Feature engineering for temporal and demographic analysis
- Exploratory and diagnostic analytics
- Economic data integration (FRED)
- Time-series forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet)
- Data quality validation and anomaly detection
- Analytical visualization and storytelling
